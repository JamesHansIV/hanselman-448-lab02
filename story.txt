Three rings for the elven kings under the sky,
Seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for mortal man doom to die,
One for the dark lord on his dark throne,
In the land of mordor, where the shadows lie.
One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them,
One ring to bring them all, And in the darkness bind them.
In the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie.

-From The Lord of the Rings

And yet, never grows?

First they champ,
Then they stamp,
Then they stand still

This thing all thing devours:
Birds, besasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron, bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.
